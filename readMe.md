Hello Guyz...This is the POSTAWAY PROJECT - II .

It is the Project based on REST APIs and MongoDB.

The following things need to be implemented in this Project --

1. REST APIs
2. Middlewares
3. JWT Authentication
4. Logging
5. Error Handling
6. Documentation using Swagger

7. Connecting MongoDB
8. Performing operations on MongoDB
9. Connecting to database using Mongoose
10. OTP feature using Nodemailer

Use "localhost:3200/api-docs" for proper documentation and to check all APIs.

Thankyou,
PRASHANT AGRAWAL
